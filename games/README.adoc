= Games for the Micro-PET family

There are two categories of games:

* Colour-PET compatible
* Native Micro-PET

As the Colour-PET is an established platform (that is re-created by the Micro-PET),
some games have been ported to the Colour-PET, and can run on the Micro-PET.

NOTE:: none of these games have been tested yet. Compatibility is based on schematics and feature comparison.

* https://milasoft64.itch.io/colour-commodore-pet-space-invaders-v1 Colour Space Invadors by milasoft (untested on upet)
* https://milasoft64.itch.io/gridrunner Jeff Minter's Gridrunner (tested & works - also joystick-enabled) 

== Joystick-enabled games

These games use the *stupid PET tricks* userport extension (which is actually older than that name for it),
that is also included in the *Ulti-PET* (but not the others!)
