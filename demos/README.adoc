= Demos for the Micro-PET family

There are two categories of demos:

* Colour-PET compatible
* Native Micro-PET

As the Colour-PET is an established platform (that is re-created by the Micro-PET),
some games have been ported to the Colour-PET, and can run on the Micro-PET.

Demos are notoriously timing-sensitive, especially the newer ones, so the Colour-PET demos may or may not
work on the Micro-PET
