= Benchmarks


Benchmark display::
	The *bench* program - as created by running *make* - measures the system speed,
	and displays it on the screen.

Comparison with other machines::
	The sub-repository link:../cbm-benchmarks[*cbm-benchmarks*] contains a set of benchmarks that have been
	run on different machines as well, and allow a comparison with the Micro-PET family of machines.
